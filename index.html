<h1>Withdrawing Money from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>While it's convenient enough to visit your local bank in order to withdraw money at the counter, Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) have proliferated around our town centres and urban areas for many years. Yet for some - especially members of the older generation - withdrawing money via an ATM can seem a daunting task.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we're going to walk through the procedure for withdrawing money, step-by-step.</p>
<h2>Approaching the ATM</h2>
<p>The ATM will usually be recessed into the outer wall of a bank, shop or other building. You may well find a queue of people standing between you and the machine. Do not be alarmed: simply join the back of the queue and await your turn.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Once you're confronted by the ATM, you will see an angled console with some numeric keys at the bottom, and a display screen immediately above it. Wait until a message appears on the screen prompting you to "Please insert card". To the right of the screen, you will see a horizontal slot, usually conspicuous by the fact there is a flashing light above it. This is where you should insert your debit card after first removing it from your purse or wallet. You should insert the card with the brown magnetic strip facing down and on the right-hand side. Don't worry if you accidentally insert the card the wrong way around: the machine will simply reject it and return it to you. If this happens, a message will appear on the screen asking you to insert the card using the correct orientation.</p>
<h2>Keying in your PIN</h2>
<p>Once the card has been accepted into the slot, the light will stop flashing and a message will appear on the screen asking you to enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN). This is the number your card provider issued you separately after sending out your card, and is something you should have memorized without writing it down. It's important that you don't keep any written record of the PIN which might become accessible to a thief who also happened to come into possession of your card.</p>

<p>Simply type in the four digits of your pin using the numeric keypad. If you make a mistake, just press the cancel button. Your card will be ejected, and when the machine asks you to insert the card once more, you may simply begin the process again.</p>

<p>If you typed the PIN correctly, you'll be granted access to a number of options, all of which will be visible on the screen.</p>
<h2>Getting the Money</h2>
<p>The options visible on the machine will be arranged in rows and columns, one column running down each side of the screen. For each row, there is a corresponding physical button outside of the screen which you should press to select the chosen option. If there are no physical buttons outside the perimeter of the screen, you may be dealing with a touch-screen interface. In this situation, you may simply select the desired option by pointing to it with your finger and <em>touching the screen</em>.</p>

<p>Since we don't want an advice slip or statement for the purposes of this exercise, we want to select the option labelled "Cash withdrawal only", "Cash without receipt", or similar. Touch that option or press the corresponding button. You will then be presented with a list of typical cash amounts. For example:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>£10</li>
 	<li>£20</li>
 	<li>£50</li>
 	<li>£75</li>
 	<li>£100</li>
 	<li>£200</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this exercise, let's withdraw ten pounds (note: be sure you have at least ten pounds in your account before doing so. See "Checking your balance" in the "Advanced Topics" section of the next article).</p>

<p>Press the "£10" button, and respond to any subsequent questions about further services, advice slips, etc, by selecting "No" using the on-screen buttons or the physical buttons corresponding to the on-screen options. Finally, the machine will display a message along the lines of "Please take your card and await your cash" and will simultaneously eject your card, which you should immediately pull out of the slot and put back in a secure place. The ATM will then make some whirring sounds while your ten pound note travels to the dispenser. Focus your attention on the larger slot underneath the card slot, since this is where the money will be dispensed. Take care to also ensure that no bystanders are waiting to snatch your money from your hands.</p>
<h2>Now Spend It</h2>
<p>Well done! You have just withdrawn ten pounds from the ATM. You may now take this money and exchange it for goods and services in the high street. Have fun!</p>
